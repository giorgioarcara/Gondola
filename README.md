Gondola is a toolbox to facilitate Brain network analysis (and exploration) in Matlab.
It contains functions that:

- allow to handle and visualize connectivity matrices.
- allow to run statistical analysis as massive t-tests and permutation tests, or GLM testing.
- allow to plot brain networks both for exploration and for paper quality figures.
- rearrange results for statistical analysis in Matlab, or export them in common formats (e.g., csv) for analysis with other software.
 
Gondola provides an easy framework to develop code-based network analysis to allow easy to write and reproducible code. It also works as a small "boat" that allows to navigate between other existing toolboxes for network analysis and plotting (Brain Connectivity Toolbox, Network Based Statistics, BrainNetViewer).
