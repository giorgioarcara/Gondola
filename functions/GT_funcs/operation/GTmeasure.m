%% GTmeasure - Returns a GTstruct with a computed graph measure
% Gtres = GTmeasure(GTstruct, 'Field',value, 'MeasureFunc', value, 'MeasureName', value)
%
% This function calculates a graph theoretical measure using a
% function (typically from the BCT toolbox) specified in MeasureFunc.
% The resulting value is stored in a new field within the GTstruct.
%
% Inputs:
%   GTstruct (struct): A GTstruct object
%
%   Field (string, optional): The name of the field containing the matrix
%   for the graph theoretical measure calculation
%
%   MeasureFunc (string, optional): The name of the function to compute the
%   measure
%
%   MeasureName (string, optional): The name of the new field to strore the
%   computed graph theoretical measure
%
% Output:
%   GTres (struct): The original GTstruct with an additional field named as
%   MeasureName containing the computed graph measure
